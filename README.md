# Daily Games Assistant

A Python-based tool designed to assist with a variety of daily games using **Selenium** (with plans to migrate to **Playwright**) for web automation and **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI). This project aims to provide users with helpful data and insights for popular daily games like Wordle, Mini Crossword, Strands, and more.

## Features

- **Automated Data Retrieval**: Uses **Selenium** with **ChromeDriver Manager** to pull data from game websites.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with **Tkinter** for an intuitive and interactive experience.
- **Planned Migration to Playwright**: Future updates will replace Selenium with **Playwright** for improved performance and reliability.
